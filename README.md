SpectrusJS
==========

A numerical library for JavaScript.  Typed vectors and matrices.  Particular spectral applications & multivariate statistics in mind.  Some state machine stuff sprinkled in.

So far, vectors are implemented (needs better testing).  Next up are matrices, and then probably eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and PCA.
