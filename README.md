SpectrusJS
==========

A fast numerical library for JavaScript.  Typed vectors and matrices.  Particular spectral applications & multivariate statistics in mind.  Some state machine stuff sprinkled in.

Currently in progress; stuff like median, qr, eigenvectors, global cluster coeff, etc. aren't working yet.  Other bugs might be scattered around.  I've been developing this locally, and pushing here every so often in case anyone's interested!

Next up I'll work on eigen values, PCA, network metrics, etc.

Update: It turns out my work on this mostly comes from what I need to use it for, so spectral stuff isn't my top priority.  It would be great if someone implemented qr/eigen stuff, but until I get around to it, it's looking like more general statistical stuff will make it in first.
