SpectrusJS
==========

A numerical library for JavaScript.  Typed vectors and matrices.  Particular spectral applications & multivariate statistics in mind.  Some state machine stuff sprinkled in.

So far, vectors are implemented (needs better testing).  Next up are matrices, and then probably eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and PCA.

Debating whether or not to include an exhaustive interpolation module, or make that a separate project that runs ontop of this.
