SpectrusJS
==========

A fast numerical library for JavaScript.  Typed vectors and matrices.  Particular spectral applications & multivariate statistics in mind.  Some state machine stuff sprinkled in.

Currently in progress; stuff like median, qr, eigenvectors, global cluster coeff, etc. aren't working yet.  Other bugs might be scattered around.  I've been developing this on and off for different projects over the past couple years, and pushing here every so often in case anyone's interested!  So, there could be some assembly required for your platform.

Next up I'll work on eigen values, PCA, network metrics, etc.
